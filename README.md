## Automated Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms 

Test Script for the automated evaluation of the performance of default machine learning algorithms. Methods for preprocessing the data may be added beforehand to show rudimentary impact of these methods in combination with the ML Algorithms. Start by adding the datasets to be evaluated to the "Datasets" folder.


Restrictions:
- Only datasets with a single column that functions as the target variable
- Used ML algorithms and preprocessing methods are only used with the default settings of the library they are imported from
